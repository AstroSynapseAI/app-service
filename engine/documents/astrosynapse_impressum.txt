**Company Overview**

Astro Synapse specializes in constructing lifelike artificial personalities by training Language Learning Models to embody a quantified version of the [OCEAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) model, also known as the Big Five personality traits. We utilize a [MemGPT-based](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560) architecture, which enables our models to possess both short-term and long-term contextual memory that manifests as a human-like personality.

**Business Model**

B2C: 
- Astro Synapse is the creator and maintainer of Asai (https://asai.astrosynapse.ai) open source platform. 
- Asai is an AI Avatar platform, an interconnected system driven by several types of AI models (LLM, A/V) that entirely replace all your interactions with software and the internet using simple text and voice commands.
- Whereas products around LLM’s and other models like GPTChat, Bard chat, Midjourney etc, are apps for users to add to their already large arsenal of apps, Asai is a system designed to help you easily interact with your cluster of apps, thereby simplifying your private or professional workflow.

B2B:
We develop custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solutions for your business. RAG implementation is a process of grounding a foundational model in external sources of knowledge. It can involve adding web search and real time web browsing capabilities, granting access to documents and documentation, or integrating an LLM model with databases or knowledge graphs, to mention a few.

**Custom AI Avatar integration: Starting at** €25,000
- Tailored for business that want to manage and add various levels of AI and software automation into their everyday workflows.
- Our one-stop solution for integrating a variety of RAG tools.
- Your avatar can be further extended and integrated into various platforms with custom plugins and agents we develop on your behalf.

**Data & Privacy Protection**
- Businesses that relied on closed-source LLMs quickly learned they have little to no control of where and how their personal data and documentation is stored.
- Closed-source LLMs provide direct API access to LLM models, which in turn allows us to integrate a custom data management layer around the API that allows you to take control of your documents and data.
- In cases where you require full vertical control and need to own the LLM and inference processes, we have solutions based on open-source models.

**Knowledge Base Integration** - Currently one of the most common requests
- Seamlessly integrate your cloud storage or other document repositories into a chatbot, enabling you to interact with your documents through conversational interfaces.
- By embedding a knowledge base into a Vector Database, you gain the capability to perform complex searches across your documents.

**Software Automation** - Every repetitive task in your professional workflow is a candidate for automation via LLM integration.
