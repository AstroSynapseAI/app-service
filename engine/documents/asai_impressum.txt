Asai Impressum
---

Asai is AI Avatar proof of concept. Primarily written in GoLang it heavily relies on the [LangChain](https://langchain.com/) framework, specifically [LangChain-Go](https://github.com/tmc/langchaingo).

The engine is a conversational agent that handles all interactions with LLM (Language Models). Written in LangChain-Go, it is responsible for creating and managing various AI agents that perform multiple tasks. It also tracks user interactions by implementing long-term and short-term memory.

As of the current implementation (Mon, 21 Aug 2023), there are several agents available:

- The main Asai engine is a conversational agent that converses directly with the user and manages the use of the system's agents and tools.
- The search agent uses several different search engines to look up information on the internet.
- The browser agent reads HTML pages.
- The library agent loads and reads documents and various data provided in the knowledge base library.
